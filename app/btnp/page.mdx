# {title}

The `btnp()` function is similar to [`btn()`](Btn "wikilink") except
that it only reports that a button is on if it was not pressed during
the previous frame. In other words, it returns `true` only if a given
button was pressed just now, and does not report `true` again for the
same button in the next frame even if it is held down.

This is useful for detecting button presses that are meant to select
menu options or initiate actions. If you were to use `btn()` to initiate
an action, the player is likely to initiate the action multiple times
that they didn't intend, because the button will register as on for
multiple frames.

`btnp()` implements a keyboard-like repeat mechanism: if the player
holds the button for 15 frames, it registers as on again for one frame,
then again every four frames after that. The frame counter resets when
the player releases the button.

Like `btn()`, `btnp()` can take a button number and a player number and
return `true` or `false`, or can be called without arguments to return a
bitfield of button states.

See [`btn()`](Btn "wikilink") for a description of the arguments and
return values.

## Predefined button values

The [P8SCII](P8SCII "wikilink") character set includes 26 special glyphs
that can be typed by holding <kbd>Shift</kbd> and pressing a letter from
<kbd>A</kbd> to <kbd>Z</kbd> in the code editor or the prompt. PICO-8
pre-defines 26 single-character global variables with names from this
set of glyphs and gives them useful values. In the case of `btnp()` the
ones associated with U, D, L, R, O, and X (⬆️, ⬇️, ⬅️, ➡️, 🅾️, and ❎)
are useful, because they represent the corresponding button indices 0
through 5.

These can be used as an argument to `btnp()` (or
[btn()](Btn "wikilink")) to represent the corresponding button. Do *not*
surround the value in quotes, because these are not strings, they are
predefined global variables with single glyphs for names.

``` lua
-- test for the "left" button, typed as shift + l
if btnp(⬅️) and x > 0 then
 x -= 1
end
```

## Examples

``` lua
sel = 0
items = {"a", "b", "c", "d",
         "e", "f", "g", "h"}

function _update()
  if (btnp(0) and sel > 0) sel -= 1
  if (btnp(1) and sel < #items - 1) sel += 1
end

function _draw()
  cls()

  for i=1,#items do
    print(items[i], 10 * i, 10, 7)
  end

  rect(8 + (sel * 10), 8,
       14 + (sel * 10), 16,
       8)
end
```

Try replacing `btnp()` with `btn()` to see what happens.
